# Programming-Theory-and-Exercises
I will upload here programming lessons, tutorials and exercises, all written by me. 

They are in no way intended to substitute any proper programming classes, but rather offer a second support and  material for students that want to / need to practice and improve their programming skills.

Notes & Exercises
---------------------
There are two types of items to this repository: Theory notes and Exercises.

Theory notes are intended as quick cheat sheets for studying, explaining briefly the why's and the how to's. They are specific to the programming language being discussed and will be properly tagged with their names.

Exercises are generic and not specific to any programming language. In case of exceptions, as in "this programming language doesn't allow me to do that", they will be noted next to the exercise statement, offering another way to be able to carry out the exercise, if possible.


Actual Theory
---------------------
Actual, general programming theory is something I would like to write in the long run, but that is not in the current scope of this repository.

I will, however, take the time to write something if I'm asked to. This repository's goal is to help students learn programming, so I will be glad to.


Basic vs. Advanced
---------------------
Basic implies variables, arrays, strings, files, conditional and loop statements, input/output, and a few other things.

Advanced would be diving into linked lists, queues, stacks, algorithms, etc. Same as in Actual Theory, I'm still not going into this. 


Contacting me
